// by starting from the number 1 and repeatedly either adding 5 or multiplying by 3, 
// an infinite set of numbers can be produced. How would you write a 
// function that, given a number, tries to find a sequence of such additions and 
// multiplications that produces that number? For example, the number 13 could be reached by first 
// multiplying by 3 and then adding 5 twice, whereas the number 15 cannot be reached at all.
